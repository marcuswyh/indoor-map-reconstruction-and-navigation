# Indoor map reconstruction and navigation
###Final year project for Bachelor's in Computer Science

An indoor navigation system approach without prior knowledge or device requirements was proposed and implemented. Users of the system need only a taken photo of a directory map and directory lot listing for navigation to take place. The system is achieved through implementation of perspective correction, text recognition, lot segmentation with labeling, and routing techniques.
