# Indoor map reconstruction and navigation
### Final year project for Bachelor's in Computer Science

An indoor navigation system approach without prior knowledge or device requirements was proposed and implemented. Users of the system need only a taken photo of a directory map and directory lot listing for navigation to take place. The system is achieved through implementation of perspective correction, text recognition, lot segmentation with labeling, and routing techniques.

Done using Python, OpenCV and Google Visions API.
